Done:
• icons © greenmap -OK
• permalinks ~OK done with hash in browser url.
• "fork me at github"-badge -OK
• Search box (for e.g. jump to location)
  http://mapbbcode.org/leaflet.html very primitive, but works - takes first Nominatim hit, no possibility to choose :-/
  https://github.com/smeijer/L.GeoSearch Demo not working, have to try
  Overpass Turbo implementation: - dunno from where he has ist, seems to be copied.
  http://labs.easyblog.it/maps/leaflet-search/examples/nominatim.html - good looking and functionality, but: hangs on map load, BG map displayed and pannable only after some time :-/
    -OK fixed with resorting to add search code at last
• 'Locate me' button instead of automatic geolocation on load
  https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol doesn't work with latest jquery and leaflet
    try to rewrite to version with minimal function. -OK
• adding POIs from overpass to marker layer with bulk methods -OK

• different icon-sets for the distinct maps
• opening_hours support  (is it open now?)
• "Download this data" - Link (Overpass-Export)
• edit in JOSM / iD -Link
• Display coordinates
• in Popup „Route here“ with link to OSRM
• popup language translation
• popup links to tags (to osm-wiki - what does this tag mean?)
• statistics: how many POIs loaded (like overpass-turbo)
• layers with different needs
    1st step: layer checkbox(es) in layer-menu -OK
    2nd step: more layers (different overpass-queries)
      question: 
        ? one query, and sort into different layers → goal should be to reduce queries
        ? more queries, and feed each into its own layer?
      ? what if an object belongs to more than one layer?
      ? how to do clustering?
        must be done over ALL layers → only one layer possible!
        → we cannot use Leaflet layer switcher 

    3rd step: generate overpass-queries from taxonomy.json

Performance:
• reduce queries to Overpass-Server
  · when zooming in below 12, do not query
  · keep (how?) a "List" of visited places, and do not query if we were already there

• maxzoom up to 19

clustering
  Leaflet.markercluster -OK
  TODO: 
    • generic icons for clusters 
    
translations via transifex
  how to fetch translations? should be fetched realtime (at loading of website)

implement API (at first via sourced JSON file)


todo: on transformap.co not ONE map, but many .... tiled 'previews' n' with link to distinct maps
	* Organic map -OK
	* Regional map -OK
	* Gratis-map
	* Needs-karte
	* Political Map
	* fairtrade-Map
	* garden-map
	* ...

FIXME
  POIs doesn't work with IE8 on WinXP
