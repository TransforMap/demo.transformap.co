    latest version requires leaflet 0.7 - we are using 0.4.4 -switch OK

  Leaflet.markercluster dl ok, eingebunden

    var markers = L.markerClusterGroup(); //call on each update? -OK
    for i
      var marker = L.marker(new L.LatLng(a[0], a[1]), { title: title }); //exactly the same as original Leaflet -OK
      marker.bindPopup(title); //seems also to be the same -OK

      markers.addLayer(marker); 

    map.addLayer(markers); //try to add only on Map-init -OK

  was designed for static data, could be a problem on update? -OK seems to be no prob
  TODO: 
    • generic icons -OK

translations via transifex

implement API (at first via sourced JSON file)
    what is needed:
        an array called "needs" where for each need, the corresponding OSM-objects are stored in an arrays as tuples, e.g. 
            needs = { 
                "food+drink" : [
                      { "amenity" : "pub" , "food" : "yes" } ,
                      { "amenity" : "restaurant" } ,
                      { "shop" : "butcher" },
                      ...
                    ]
        but to show them on transformap, they additionally need:
            either
                political_identity:* - wobei wir hier die ganze liste als array angeben

    wenn sortiert nach commons, dann brauchen wir eine Liste aller Objekte, die "commons" sind:
      commons = [ 
        { amenity : "drinking_water", "access" : "¬private|¬no" } ,
        { leisure : "playground", "access" : "¬private|¬no" } ,
        { "service:bicycle:diy" : "yes" },
        { "service:bicycle:tools" : "yes" },

  how to fetch translations? should be fetched realtime (at loading of website)
